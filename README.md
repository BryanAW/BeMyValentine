# Be My Valentine

This project is a simple and sweet way to propose to your partner to be your Valentine. It's a web page that displays a cute message and a gif, asking the question, "Will you be my Valentine?".

## How it Works

The page presents two buttons to the user: "Yes" and "No". The "Yes" button will confirm the acceptance, while the "No" button playfully moves around the page when the user tries to click on it.

## Usage

Feel free to use this code as a base for your own Valentine's Day proposal, or any other occasion where you want to ask a fun question. You're welcome to modify the code as you see fit to suit your needs.

## Open Use

This project is open use. You can change, distribute, and use this code as you wish. There are no restrictions.
